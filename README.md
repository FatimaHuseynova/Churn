Churn Analysis Summary
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various machine learning techniques. The main steps include:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded, and necessary preprocessing steps are applied, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Various plots and statistical summaries are used to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable (churn).
Feature Selection:

Techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance from models, and recursive feature elimination (RFE) are employed to select the most relevant features for predicting churn.
Model Training:

Several machine learning models are trained, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and possibly more advanced methods like gradient boosting or neural networks.
Model Evaluation:

The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Cross-validation may also be used to ensure the model's robustness.
Model Interpretation:

Important features contributing to churn prediction are identified, providing insights into the factors that most influence customer retention.
